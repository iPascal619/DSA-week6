# README

This README provides setup and usage instructions for four different C programs, each named `task1.c` to `task4.c`. These tasks include:
- **Task 1: Music Player Setup Guide**
- **Task 2: Binary Search Tree Database Setup Guide**
- **Task 3: Social Network Recommendation System Setup Guide**
- **Task 4: Emergency Room Patient Management Setup Guide**

Each task has its own instructions for installation, compilation, and usage.

## Task 1: Music Player Setup Guide

This guide helps you set up and run a **Music Playlist Manager** that uses PortAudio for audio playback and libsndfile for reading audio files.

### System Requirements
- C compiler (GCC or Clang)
- CMake (for building PortAudio)
- Git (for cloning repositories)

### Setup and Compilation

1. **Install PortAudio and libsndfile** (See specific instructions for Windows, macOS, or Linux).
2. Save the music player code as `task1.c`.
3. Compile the program:
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     gcc -o task1 task1.c -IC:\portaudio\include -IC:\libsndfile\include -LC:\portaudio\build\Release -LC:\libsndfile\bin -lportaudio -lsndfile-1
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     gcc -o task1 task1.c -lportaudio -lsndfile
     ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./task1
Extending the Program
Add features like pausing, skipping, or dynamic playlist modification.
Task 2: Binary Search Tree Database Setup Guide
This guide helps you set up and run a Binary Search Tree (BST) Database for product management.

System Requirements
C compiler (GCC or Clang)
Basic command-line knowledge
Setup and Compilation
Save the code as task2.c.
Compile the program:
bash
Copy code
gcc -o task2 task2.c
Run the program:
bash
Copy code
./task2
Extending the Program
Add user input, file saving/loading, delete operations, or additional product attributes.
Task 3: Social Network Recommendation System Setup Guide
This guide helps you set up and run a Social Network Recommendation System that uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to suggest new connections.

System Requirements
C compiler (GCC or Clang)
Basic command-line knowledge
Setup and Compilation
Save the code as task3.c.
Compile the program:
bash
Copy code
gcc -o task3 task3.c
Run the program:
bash
Copy code
./task3
Extending the Program
Add user input, file saving/loading, alternative recommendation algorithms, or more detailed user profiles.
Task 4: Emergency Room Patient Management Setup Guide
This guide helps you set up and run an Emergency Room Patient Management system that uses a Max-Heap to prioritize patients based on the severity of their condition.

System Requirements
C compiler (GCC or Clang)
Basic command-line knowledge
Setup and Compilation
Save the code as task4.c.
Compile the program:
bash
Copy code
gcc -o task4 task4.c
Run the program:
bash
Copy code
./task4
Extending the Program
Add user input, file saving/loading, additional patient details, or a user interface.
Troubleshooting
Ensure your C compiler is correctly installed and your PATH is set up properly.
For runtime errors, check for array bounds, invalid input, or configuration issues.
Refer to online programming resources and forums for additional assistance.
This README serves as a comprehensive guide for setting up and extending each of these tasks. Adjust and enhance the programs to suit your specific requirements.
